      hash: 0caef7d5c6764c7a5d0329eb96fbc6133c76c171
      body: |
        Truncate does not support decimals in sizes, so some human-readable
        sizes like 3.2T would fail.

        Instead, just count the number of 1-byte blocks and provide
        that as the size to truncate.

        This can still be overridden with env vars.
